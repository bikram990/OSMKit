    <description>I consider my "home" area for mapping to be New Westminster and the adjoining parts of Burnaby, as well as UBC and Surrey. I have high resolution imagery sources for Surrey, so if you're interested in mapping there and want them, let me know.

I maintain [ogr2osm](https://github.com/pnorman/ogr2osm), a program to convert data to .osm format and tags.

I'm a member of the Data Working Group and deal mainly with imports. I can help with reverting imports or mistakes.
